Decentralized Voting System on XRPL
This project is a decentralized voting system built on the XRPL (XRP Ledger) using Next.js 14 and TypeScript. The system allows users to create votes, cast votes, and view the results, leveraging blockchain technology for secure and transparent voting.

Features
Create Votes: Users can create a new vote with a unique ID and a list of options.
Cast Votes: Users can cast their vote for a specific option in an existing vote.
View Results: Users can view the results of a vote by entering the vote ID.
Technologies Used
Next.js 14: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
XRPL: XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain platform.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
